# Python.New-York-Citi-Bike
New York Citi Bike has been having distribution problems, which results in the increase of bike shortage at popular bike stations and therefore in the increase of customer complaints. This dashboard will help tackle these problems. Right now, New York Citi bikes are often not available at popular stations at certain times. This analysis locates the details of these problems so a strategy can be created to solve them. 
# Python Dashboard via Streamlit

# Key Questions
-	What are the most popular bike start stations across the city for Citi Bike rental and where are they?
-	Are the existing stations evenly distributed over the city? 
-	What are the most common routes between stations? 
-	Which are the months with the most bike rides and which months have the least? Are seasons a factor? 
-	Extra question interesting for the analysis: Which type of bike is mostly used?
# Data
For this project I have used the monthly data of NY Citi Bike for the year 2022, in total existing of more than 30 million rows.
I also added weather data from New York using NOAA's API service.
# Tools
For this project I used Python, Visual Studio Code and the following libraries:
- Pandas: for data analization
- Matplotlib: for data visualization
- Numpy: for mathematical equations
- plotly: for converting large numbers into readable strings
- streamlit: for data visualization
- keplergl: for visual exploration of large-scale geolocation data sets.
- numerize: for converting large numbers into readable strings
- pillow: for image processing
